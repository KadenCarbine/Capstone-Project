Hello
=====

This is my Capstone project for my Coding Bootcamp.
---------------------------------------------------

Here are a few things that I included in this project!

### As some context, this is an fake ecommerce website that is meant to look and feel like a normal shopping site. Just with fake data, and not a way to pay.

*   There is a landing page which includes all the items that you can "shop" for.
*   There is a navbar, which includes a lnk to the cart page.
*   I created a filter, so that you can only look at products that you are interested in.
*   Next, there is a see more button on each product, so that you can get a better description of what the product is.
*   Finally, there is a cart where you can add things, and take away things from your fake cart to make it feel like you are really shopping.

This is all that is currently in this app, but I hope to continue to add more and make it even better.
